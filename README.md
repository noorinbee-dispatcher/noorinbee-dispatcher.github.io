   <h1>How did we get here?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The Noorinbee Dispatch runs by the wire, sharing access to useful information in the region.
            <br>
            <li>It offers a ground point against the zombie scroll of social media networks.</li>
            <li>The focus is on Victorian postcodes 3889, 3890 and 3891 with Cann River as a centre.</li>
            <li>We are open to mediate messaging between individuals and community groups; aiming to integrate
                automations for this purpose without the bluster and mixed agenda of social media feeds.</li>
            <li>Please contact us if you would like content appraised for inclusion, or links provisioned to other
                sites.</li>
        </p>
